我决定把所有的笔记和学习记录都开源，由于是新手，有些文献代码都是参考行内大神参考学习的，有些解释部分可能有误，既然是开源也希望能够得到pr指正。

~~目前我想做的方向是半监督医学图像分割，参照[这里面的文献](https://github.com/HiLab-git/SSL4MIS)学习，还没有找到合适的选题与方向，代码部分也在自己学习整理，希望早日完成自己喜欢的事情。~~

现在做的是课程学习的方向，笔记也会每日记录，每周总结一次不仅是学习上的还有生活中的。

学习路线也不是很懂，一路上有大家的支持和鼓励，非常感谢！

I decided to make all my notes and learning records open source. Since I am a novice, some literature codes are learned with reference from experts in the industry. Some explanations may be wrong. Since it is open source, I hope to get corrections from pr.

~~Currently, the direction I want to pursue is semi-supervised medical image segmentation. I refer to [the literature here](https://github.com/HiLab-git/SSL4MIS) to study. I haven’t found a suitable topic and direction yet, and the code part is also unclear. I am learning to organize myself, hoping to complete the things I like as soon as possible.~~

What I am doing now is the direction of Curriculum Learning. Notes will be recorded every day. Once a week, I will summarize not only the study but also the life.

I don’t understand the learning route very well. Thank you very much for everyone’s support and encouragement along the way!
