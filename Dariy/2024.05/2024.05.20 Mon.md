即然是第一份github上的日记，那就写一个冲动：**创造刀剑神域**。我觉得无论这个想法有多么幼稚，回首过往的经历，花费很多时间去做了不喜欢的事情，我现在明白即使在不喜欢的领域取得了多么大的成就自己依旧不开心，因为不是自己喜欢的吧。现在有了这辈子最想做的事情，那么与这个没有关系的事情的权重我可以有所调整，我可以更加坚定的远离之前走过的路，选择自己喜欢的路。***不论这条路是否有人走过，不论是否有人愿意陪我，这些都不重要，重要的是你这辈子想做什么***。可能会考量着走论文极大可能是保送不了研究生的，但是雷政，还请你不要目光短浅，人生不止是研究生，你喜欢的你想做的也不是研究生，是这个可能略显幼稚的目标，刀剑神域。之前走过的弯路，觉得浪费了多少时间其实都无所谓，这也是成长的过程。***学会独处，学会坚持，学会对抗质疑与焦虑***。***有时候正是无人看好之人成就了无人能及之事***。（摘抄自模仿游戏，艾兰图灵）-**2024.05.20 10:38**

Since this is the first diary on github, let me write about an impulse: **to create Sword Art Online**. I think no matter how naive this idea is, looking back on my past experiences and spending a lot of time doing things I don’t like, I now understand that even if I achieve great success in a field I don’t like, I’m still unhappy because it’s not what I like. Now that I have what I want to do most in my life, I can adjust the weight of things that have nothing to do with it. I can stay more determined to stay away from the path I have taken before and choose the path I like. ***No matter whether anyone has walked this road, whether anyone is willing to accompany me, these are not important. What is important is what you want to do in this life***. You may consider that doing a thesis will most likely not lead to graduate school, but Lei Zheng, please don’t be short-sighted. Life is more than graduate school. What you like and want to do is not graduate school. This may be a slightly naive goal, Sword Art Online. It doesn’t matter how much time I have taken in the past, and it doesn’t matter how much time I have wasted. This is also a process of growth. ***Learn to be alone, learn to persevere, and learn to fight doubt and anxiety***. ***Sometimes it’s the very people who no one imagines anything of who do the things no one can imagine.**. (Excerpted from The Imitation Game, Alan Turing） -**2024.05.20 11:05**

好像不是很会用这个Github的桌面端应用，主要是桌面端我还不会更改文件内容这个操作，其他像clone这个操作学会了。 -**2024.05.20 11:38**

---

I don’t seem to be very good at using Github’s desktop application. Mainly because I don’t know how to change the file content on the desktop. I have learned other operations like cloning. -**2024.05.20 11:39**

突然想到这个我的笔记就可以在github上面写啊，我把代码文件都挂在这上面，还有要是有什么资料的话也可以放在这里，整理起来也方便。然后写一个技术性的一个小计划就是我想把kaggle上面的一些关于医学图像分割的代码可以贴上去。就在这个里面添加一个文件夹写作kagglecode，再写一个acmcode，还有的话可以写一写无语的课程期末试卷或者笔记之类的我觉得可以呀，就用markdown写就行，还有的话可以穿入一些图片之类的，视频链接，就是把所有的都整理好放在这里就OK。开始弄！ -**2024.05.20 11:47**

It suddenly occurred to me that I can write my notes on GitHub. I hang all the code files here, and if there is any information, I can also put it here. It is also convenient to organize. Then I wrote a small technical plan. I wanted to post some codes on medical image segmentation on kaggle. Just add a folder here to write kagglecode, and then write acmcode. If there is anything else, you can write a speechless course final exam paper or notes. I think it is okay. Just use markdown to write it. If there is anything else, you can Insert some pictures, video links, etc., just organize everything and put it here. Get started! -**2024.05.20 11:47**

添加了之前整理的acm的string相关的算法模板，是参考大佬的，在文件内部已经表明出处了。由于很多原因吧，训练了很多，写了codeforces，(https://codeforces.com/profile/DL_From_Scratch) 最后还是放弃了，没事，没事，没事。等会整理一下kaggle上面的半监督医学图像分割，中午休息一下下午就开始看kaggle的代码。 -**2024.05.20 11:57**

Added the algorithm template related to acm's string that was compiled before. It is a reference to the big brother, and the source has been indicated inside the file. Due to many reasons, I trained a lot and wrote codeforces, but finally gave up. It’s okay, it’s okay, it’s okay. I will sort out the semi-supervised medical image segmentation on kaggle later. I will take a break at noon and start looking at kaggle code in the afternoon. -**2024.05.20 11:57**

好，刚刚已经学会如何使用桌面端上传大小超过25M的文件了，现在就是想把这个日记的形式还是用Typora写，不用在github网页上编辑，直接在这里编辑好之后在桌面端提交修改申请就OK了。所以刚刚上传了乳腺癌诊断的相关文件，见文件夹内整理的资料，后续资料我会再学一下如何合并到一起把相关的文件。真的够了，吃饭去了。-**2024.05.20 12:31**

Okay, I just learned how to use the desktop to upload files larger than 25M. Now I just want to write this diary in Typora. I don’t need to edit it on the github page. I can edit it directly here and submit a modification request on the desktop. OK. So I just uploaded the relevant files for breast cancer diagnosis. See the information organized in the folder. I will learn how to merge the related files together in the follow-up information. That's enough, let's go eat. -**2024.05.20 12:33**

刚刚把乳腺癌诊断部分的名称都用代码提取出来了，现在就是开始看17篇论文，写一下学习笔记，然后晚上再找一些kaggle的题目学习。 -**2024.05.20 13:28**

I have just extracted the names of the breast cancer diagnosis part with code. Now I am starting to read 17 papers, write study notes, and then find some Kaggle topics to study at night.  -**2024.05.20 13:29**

现在把第一篇论文看完了，整体的感受就是这个代码的逻辑非常清楚是我喜欢的风格。前面是定义函数，后面是主函数以及参数的设置，最后所有的执行操作都通过shell进行，非常nice！然后就是整个网络的架构图，能把这一张图片看懂，整个论文也就算学到一点知识了。后续再找一下怎么在Markdown里面插入图片，一直都有问题。

总结一下这篇论文就是，通过把输入图像进行预处理，采用裁剪的手法，然后再提取乳腺图像的最佳中心点，记录处理后的图片以及保存地址列表。最后输送到模型中进行学习。

整体的模型有全局模型，局部模型和融合模型，同样对应着三个BCE损失函数。在全局模型中，首先对输入的图像进行低容量全局网络处理可以得到图片的显著特征图片，然后可以和人工标注的图片做一个BCE；这个特征图片经过ROI得到补丁后的图片，把补丁后的图片和原始图片融合裁剪之后就是ROI图片，对这个图片进行高容量局部网络模型，得到特征向量之后做一个attention得到注意力权重表示然后将全局模型中得到的卷积层做一个池化操作两者相拼接，送给sigmoid与标注的图片对比得到一个BCE。最终的损失就由这三者的加权得到，不断改进更新模型。

Now that I have finished reading the first paper, my overall feeling is that the logic of this code is very clear and it is my favorite style. The first step is to define the function, followed by the main function and parameter settings. Finally, all execution operations are performed through the shell, which is very nice! Then there is the architecture diagram of the entire network. If you can understand this picture, you will have learned a little knowledge about the entire paper. I will try to find out how to insert pictures into Markdown later, but I still have problems.

To summarize this paper, the input image is preprocessed, using cropping techniques, and then extracting the best center point of the breast image, recording the processed image and saving the address list. Finally, it is sent to the model for learning.

The overall model includes a global model, a local model and a fusion model, which also correspond to three BCE loss functions. In the global model, the input image is first processed by a low-capacity global network to obtain the salient feature image of the image, and then a BCE can be made with the manually annotated image; this feature image is processed through the ROI to obtain the patched image, and the patched image is obtained The ROI image is obtained after fusion and cropping of the image and the original image. A high-capacity local network model is applied to this image. After obtaining the feature vector, an attention is made to obtain the attention weight representation, and then a pooling operation is performed on the convolution layer obtained from the global model. The two are spliced together and sent to the sigmoid to compare with the annotated picture to obtain a BCE. The final loss is obtained by weighting these three factors, and the model is constantly improved and updated.  -**2024.05.20 15:14**

第二篇论文讲的是如何通过Pix2pix得到乳腺癌免疫组织化学图像，并且作者是利用金字塔结构改进了一下这个cGAN以便得到更好的效果。但这个不是我所感兴趣的，所以就只要看懂下面网络架构图片就可以了。 -**2024.05.20 15:50**

The second paper talks about how to obtain breast cancer immunohistochemistry images through Pix2pix, and the author used the pyramid structure to improve this cGAN to get better results. But this is not what I am interested in, so I just need to understand the following network architecture picture.  -**2024.05.20 15:50**

怎么说，这里17篇论文，只有第一篇是和我想看的相关的。第一篇是弱监督学习，提出三个损失三个模型，第二个有点用但是是cGAN和我想了解的半监督图像分割识别不相关，后面的也有很多不相关的论文，再就是一些很久以前的像什么利用深度学习进行癌症检测，这种太宽泛了，就是让人抓不住重点，就是感觉从头介绍一些卷积神经网络，这种论文看完了也不会有什么想法。所以还是得像第一篇这种类似的论文。要不就是下次还是自己找一下论文，看完了再找下一篇论文，不要就是看这个合集然后其实好多都不是自己想要的，时间也耗着了，而且自己又想把这些都看完。ok下面先看kaggle上找一个实例代码看一下吧。-**2024.05.20 20:15**

What should I say, of the 17 papers here, only the first one is related to what I want to read. The first one is about weakly supervised learning, which proposes three losses and three models. The second one is somewhat useful, but cGAN is not relevant to the semi-supervised image segmentation recognition I want to know about. There are also many irrelevant papers in the following ones, and some that have been around for a long time. The previous article about using deep learning for cancer detection was too broad and made people unable to grasp the key point. It just felt like introducing some convolutional neural networks from the beginning. After reading this kind of paper, I would not have any ideas. So it still has to be a similar paper like the first one. Either you should look for the paper by yourself next time, and then look for the next paper after reading it. Don't just read this collection and find that many of them are not what you want. Time is also wasting, and you want to read them all. . Ok, let’s look at an example code on kaggle first. -**2024.05.20 20:15**

Just study this code tonight and that’s it. -**2024.05.20 20:42**

ipython文件我整理好了，现在在于我如何学习，我想这样子，在win电脑上面把整个项目的代码自己敲一遍，然后该写注释的写一下注释。改分两个文件的就分开，全部写在一个地方确实不太好，然后等全部都能实现了之后再去考虑修改代码比如传入参数的设置，比如tqdm的进程分析等等这些都是需要的。 -**2024.05.20 22:15**

---

I have sorted out the ipython files. Now it’s about how I learn. I want to type the code of the entire project on my win computer, and then write comments where necessary. If it is divided into two files, just separate them. It is really not good to write them all in one place, and then wait until everything can be implemented before considering modifying the code, such as the setting of incoming parameters, such as the process analysis of tqdm, etc. These are all needed of. -**2024.05.20 22:15**
