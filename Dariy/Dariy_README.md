# Welcome to View My Diary!

>    今天是2024年5月20日，以后这里就当成是一个写日记打开的地方吧，也是一个督促自己学习的平台。这个readme是仅自己可见的，平时压力大的时候，没事都可以写在这里。如此的话就先声明一下：一级标题写年份，二级标题写月份，三级标题写日期，四级五级之类的就是内容上的区别了，然后加粗和斜体什么的想弄就弄吧。还有就是写一个中文写一个英文，英文直接谷歌然后学习一下就ok了，没必要自己再翻译一次，ok开始写！

>   Today is May 20, 2024. From now on, this will be regarded as a place to write a diary and a platform to supervise your own learning. This readme is only visible to you. When you are usually stressed, you can write it here if you have nothing to do. If this is the case, let’s make a statement first: the first-level headings write the year, the second-level headings write the month, the third-level headings write the date, the fourth-level and fifth-level headings are the difference in content, and then you can make bold and italics as you like. Bar. Another thing is to write one in Chinese and one in English. Just Google the English and then learn it and it will be ok. There is no need to translate it again by yourself. Okay, start writing!

> 日记单独放到Diary算了。

> Just put the diary in Diary alone.
